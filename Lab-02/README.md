# Implement the feedforward and backpropagation learning algorithm for multiple perceptrons in Python for the question provided in the attached image.
1. Initialize the weights and biases randomly.
2. Implement the forward pass.
3. Compute the loss between the predicted output and the actual output using an appropriate loss function.
4. Compute the gradients of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases using the chain rule.
5. Update the weights and biases.
6. Iterate over multiple times (epochs), performing forward propagation, loss calculation, backpropagation, and parameter updates in each iteration till convergence.
